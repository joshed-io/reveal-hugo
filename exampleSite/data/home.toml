# Note: it seems that under goldmark, markdown in data templates has issues.
#       In particular "---" is converted to <hr> even inside code fences!

Add a `example` key to data/home.toml:

```toml
example = "I'm a slide"
```
<br>

Set the `content` attribute to "home.example":

```markdown
{{</* slide content="home.example" */>}}
```

---

💡 Each data template entry can contain one or more slides, separated by `---` with newlines.

---

💡 All other slide shortcode attributes (background, transition, etc.) can be used and will be applied to each slide in the data template entry.

---

💡 Adding a new file in `data` folder requires to restart `hugo`

💡 Symbolic links are not allowed in `data` folder
